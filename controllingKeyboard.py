Qianye Ying’er appeared at Yun Che’s side. She looked him up and down once before saying, “You used the primordial yin energy in the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness to increase your cultivation by two levels. According to this speed and the seemingly non-existent ‘bottleneck’ of your Heretic God Profound Veins, you’ll be able to break through the limits of the Divine Sovereign Realm and become a Divine Master in about four or five years.”

“That’s enough.” Yun Che turned around. “Let’s return to the Soul Stealing Realm.”

When they reached the Soul Stealing Realm, Witch Chanyi and Witch Yu Wu came out to welcome them back. “Your Magnificence.”

After undergoing Yun Che’s “Dark Growth” for one entire year, the Witches, Moon Eaters, and Yama Devils had achieved an even greater compatibility with their devil god powers. Yu Wu and Chanyi’s cultivation had also grown by leaps and bounds and they had reached the ninth level of the Divine Master Realm.

If not for Yun Che’s “Dark Growth”, they would have needed at least a thousand years to reach that level of cultivation.

“Where is your master?” Yun Che asked.

“Your Magnificence, Master has not been in the Sacred Region during this period of time. However, Master has already received word of the Devil Master’s breakthrough, so she should be returning soon.”

Just as Chanyi had finished speaking, a cottony and seductive voice rang in his ears. “Oh my Lord Devil Master, are you truly so eager for action?”'''
